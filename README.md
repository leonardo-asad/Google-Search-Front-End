# Google-Search-Front-End
The objective of this project was to create my own front end for google search, as by exploring Google's interface to identify what GET parameters it expects and adding
necessary HTML and CSS to the Website.

There are three pages, the first one to make regular google searches, the second one to query for images and the last one to make advanced searches. Once the user input 
the content into the search bar and click onto the search button, the html redirects the browser to the google page.
